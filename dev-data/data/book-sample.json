During that interview, Carnegie slyly dropped a hint of a certain master power he used—a magic law of the human mind, a little-known psychological principle—that was amazing in its power. That part of the interview never made it into Hill’s magazine, but it did launch the young author on a research journey that lasted twenty years.",
